                       Question ;
             document and window objects
             
             
                        DOCUMENT :
                   
    It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
    
    All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
    
    We can access the document from a window using the window. document
    
    The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom
    (Document object model)
                   
    Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window. document.title
    
    syntax:

      document.propertyname;
      
                        WINDOW OBJECTS :  
                     
     It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of
      the  webpage. 
      
      
      Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
      

       We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window         
                     
                     
      The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
      
      
      Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
      
      
      syntax:

         window.propertyname;
